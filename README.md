# Modeling Covid Disease Spread

This repository contains the final project for the E19 - Numerical Methods of Engineering Applications course.

## Description

For this final project, we wanted to see how accurately we could model Covid-19 spread with a simple mathematical SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model. In this class we learned optimization techniques to solve ODEs such as curve-fitting, so this was a relevant project to pursue given the breadth and depth of Covid datasets online.

We cleaned and utilized the [Covid-19 Data Repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master) by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University.

## Usage

For this project, we used the pandas, matplotlib, and scipy Python libraries.
